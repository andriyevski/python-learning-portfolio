#11.1 City, Country:
## Write a function that receives two parameters: a country name and a city name. The function should return a single string in the format "City, Country"—for example, "Santiago, Chile." Save the function in a module named city_functions.py. Create a file named test_cities.py to test the function you just wrote (remember to import unittest and the function you are testing). Write a method named test_city_country() to verify that calling the function with values ​​like 'santiago' and 'chile' produces the correct string. Run test_cities.py and verify that the test_city_country() test passes.
