#11.2 Population:
## Modify your function to have a third required parameter, population. In this new version, the function should return a single string like "Santiago, Chile - population 5,000,000". Run test_cities.py again. Verify that the test_city_country() test fails this time. Modify the function so that the population parameter is optional. Run test_cities.py again and verify that the test_city_country() test passes again. Write a second test, test_city_country_population(), that tests calling the function with the values ​​'santiago', 'chile', and 'population=5,000,000'. Run test_cities.py again and verify that the new test passes.
