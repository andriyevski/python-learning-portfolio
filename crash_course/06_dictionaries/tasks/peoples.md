#Exercise 6.7: People
##Objective
###The goal of this exercise is to practice working with a list of dictionaries. You will create several dictionaries, store them in a list, and then iterate through that list to display the information contained in each dictionary.

##Instructions
###Start with the existing program from Exercise 6.1. This program should contain a dictionary representing a single person. Your dictionary should have keys like first_name, last_name, age, and city.

###Create two new dictionaries. Each of these dictionaries should represent a different person, with the same keys (first_name, last_name, age, city) as the first dictionary.

###Store all three dictionaries in a list. Name this list people.

###Loop through the people list. Use a for loop to iterate over each dictionary in the list.

###Print all information. Inside the loop, print every piece of information stored in each person's dictionary. The output should be clearly formatted so that it's easy to read.
