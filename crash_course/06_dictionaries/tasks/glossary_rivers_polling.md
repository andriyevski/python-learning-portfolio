#📘 Chapter 6 – Dictionaries
##🔁 6.4 – Glossary 2
Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, simplify the code from Exercise 6.3 by replacing the series of print statements with a loop that iterates through the dictionary’s key-value pairs.

Once you’re confident the loop works, extend your glossary by adding five more Python terms and their meanings. When you rerun the program, the new words and their definitions should appear in the output automatically.

##🌊 6.5 – Rivers
Create a dictionary containing the names of three major rivers and the countries they flow through. One possible key-value pair is 'nile': 'egypt'.

Use a loop to print a sentence about each river and the country it flows through.
Example:
The Nile runs through Egypt.

Use a loop to print the name of each river in the dictionary.

Use a loop to print the name of each country in the dictionary.

##🗣️ 6.6 – Polling
Use the code from favorite_languages.py (page 115) as a starting point.

Create a list of people who should take the programming language poll. Include some names that are already in the dictionary and some names that are not.

Loop through the list of people who should take the poll.

If they have already responded, print a message thanking them for taking the poll.

If they have not yet responded, print a message inviting them to take the poll.
