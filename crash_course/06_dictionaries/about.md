# Chapter 6: Dictionaries

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

This chapter introduces **dictionaries**, a core data structure in Python used to store information in **key-value pairs**. You’ll learn how to create, modify, access, and loop through dictionaries, including how to work with **nested dictionaries** for more complex data.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Creating Dictionaries
You’ll learn how to define a dictionary using curly braces `{}` and how to populate it with key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and values can be of any data type.

### 2. Accessing Values
You’ll explore how to retrieve values using their corresponding keys. The chapter also covers how to handle missing keys gracefully.

### 3. Adding and Modifying Entries
You’ll see how to add new key-value pairs to an existing dictionary and how to update the value of an existing key.

### 4. Removing Key-Value Pairs
You’ll learn how to delete entries from a dictionary using specific commands.

## 🔁 Looping Through Dictionaries

### - Looping Through Keys
You’ll learn how to iterate over all the keys in a dictionary.

### - Looping Through Values
You’ll explore how to access all values without referencing their keys.

### - Looping Through Key-Value Pairs
You’ll discover how to loop through both keys and values simultaneously, which is useful for displaying or processing data.

---

## 🧩 Nesting

### - Dictionaries in Lists
You’ll learn how to store dictionaries inside lists to represent multiple similar objects.

### - Lists in Dictionaries
You’ll explore how to store lists as values in a dictionary to represent multiple attributes for a single key.

### - Dictionaries in Dictionaries
You’ll see how to nest dictionaries within dictionaries to represent structured data, such as user profiles or settings.

## 🧪 Practice Tasks (Descriptions Only)

1. Define a dictionary that stores basic information about a book.
2. Display all keys and values in a dictionary using a loop.
3. Create a dictionary of users, each with nested details like name and location.
4. Remove a key-value pair from a dictionary and observe the result.
5. Use a method to safely access a key that might not exist.

## ✅ Summary

Dictionaries are a powerful way to organize and manage data in Python. They allow for fast lookups, flexible structures, and are ideal for representing real-world objects and relationships. Mastering dictionaries is essential for writing efficient and readable Python code.
