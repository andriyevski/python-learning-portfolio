#9.4. Visitors:
## start with the program from exercise 9.1 (p. 175). Add an attribute number_served with a default value of 0; it represents the number of served visitors. Create an instance named restaurant. Print the value of number_served, then change it and print it again. Add a method named set_number_served() that allows you to set the number of served visitors. Call the method with a new number, and print the value again. Add a method named increment_number_served() that increases the number of served visitors by a given amount. Call this method with any number that could represent the number of customers served â€” say, in one day.
