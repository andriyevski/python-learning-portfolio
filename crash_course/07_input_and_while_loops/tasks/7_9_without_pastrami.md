# ðŸ¥ª Exercise 7.9 â€” No More Pastrami

## Using the `sandwich_orders` list from Exercise 7.8, make sure the value `'pastrami'` appears in the list at least three times.

- At the beginning of your program, print a message stating that the deli has run out of pastrami.
- Then, use a `while` loop to remove all occurrences of `'pastrami'` from the `sandwich_orders` list.
- Finally, ensure that `'pastrami'` does not appear in the `finished_sandwiches` list.

> ðŸ’¡ This exercise helps reinforce your understanding of list manipulation and loop control in Python.
