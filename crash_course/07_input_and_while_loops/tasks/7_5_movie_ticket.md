# 🎟️ Task 7.5: Movie Ticket Pricing Based on Age

## 📝 Description
A movie theater has implemented a tiered pricing system for tickets based on the age of the visitor. Your task is to write a loop that continuously prompts the user to enter their age and then displays the corresponding ticket price.

## 💰 Pricing Rules
- Visitors **under 3 years old**: **Free ticket**
- Visitors **aged 3 to 12**: **$10 ticket**
- Visitors **older than 12**: **$15 ticket**

## 🔁 Requirements
- Use a loop to repeatedly ask the user for their age.
- After each input, display the ticket price based on the age entered.
- You may choose how to exit the loop (e.g., using a specific keyword or condition).

## 🧠 Example Interaction
Enter your age: 2
Ticket price: $0
Enter your age: 10
Ticket price: $10
Enter your age: 25
Ticket price: $15

## ✅ Bonus (Optional)
- Add input validation to ensure the age is a positive number.
- Allow the user to type `"exit"` to stop the loop.
