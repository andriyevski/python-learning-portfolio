ðŸ§ª Exercise 7.6 â€” Three Exit Strategies
Rewrite Exercise 7.4 or Exercise 7.5 using all three of the following loop exit techniques at least once:
âœ… Requirements:
- Use a while loop that ends based on a condition.
- Use a variable named active to control whether the loop continues.
- Use a break statement to exit the loop when the user enters 'quit'.
ðŸ’¡ Instructions:
- Create a program that interacts with the user (e.g., asking for age, preferences, or actions).
- Make sure each of the three exit strategies is used at least once.
- Your code should be clean, readable, and logically structured.
ðŸ§µ Example Topics:
You can base your program on:
- Movie ticket pricing (from Exercise 7.4)
- Restaurant seating logic (from Exercise 7.5)
- Or invent your own scenario!
