# Tuples
4.13. Buffet: the buffet menu in the restaurant consists of only five items. Come up with five simple dishes and save them in a tuple. • Use a for loop to display all dishes offered by the restaurant. • Try to change one of the elements and make sure that Python refuses to make changes.
• The restaurant changes the menu, replacing two items with other dishes. Add a block of code that replaces the tuple and use a for loop to output each updated menu item.
