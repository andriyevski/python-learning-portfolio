4.3. Count to 20: use the for loop to output numbers from 1 to 20 inclusive.

4.4. Million: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000, then use a for loop to
output of numbers (If the output takes too much time, stop it by pressing Ctrl+C or close the output window.)

4.5. Summing a million numbers: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000, then use the min() and max() functions to verify that the list really starts with 1 and ends with 1,000,000. Call the sum() function and see how quickly Python can sum a million numbers.

4.6. Odd numbers: Use the third argument of the range() function to create a list of odd numbers from 1 to 20. Print all the numbers in a for loop.

4.7. Triples: create a list of numbers that are multiples of 3, in the range from 3 to 30. Output all the numbers in your list in the for loop.

4.8. Cubes: the result of raising a number to the third power is called a cube. For example, cube 2 is written in Python as 2**3. Create a list of the first 10 cubes (that is, cubes of all integers from 1 to 10) and output the values of all cubes in a for loop.

4.9. Cube Generator: Use the list generator construct to generate a list of the first 10 cubes.
