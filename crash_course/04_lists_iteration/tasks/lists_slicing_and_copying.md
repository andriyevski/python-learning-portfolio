# Chapter 4: Working with Lists — Slicing, Copying, and Iteration

## 4.10. Segments
Add the following to one of the programs from this chapter:
- Print the message: "The first three items in the list are:", then use slicing to display the first three items.
- Print the message: "Three items from the middle of the list are:", then use slicing to display three items from the middle.
- Print the message: "The last three items in the list are:", then use slicing to display the last three items.

## 4.11. My Pizza, Your Pizza
Start with the program from exercise 4.1. Then:
- Create a copy of the pizza list and name it `friend_pizzas`.
- Add a new pizza to the original list.
- Add a different pizza to the `friend_pizzas` list.
- Prove that the program has two separate lists:
  - Print: "My favorite pizzas are:", then loop through the original list.
  - Print: "My friend’s favorite pizzas are:", then loop through the copied list.
  - Make sure each new pizza appears in the correct list.

## 4.12. More Loops
Choose any version of `foods.py` from this section and:
- Write two `for` loops to print each item from both lists.
