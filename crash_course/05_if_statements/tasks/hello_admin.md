ðŸ“˜ Chapter 5 â€“ Conditional Logic (Tasks 5.8 â€“ 5.10)
ðŸ”¹ 5.8. Hello Admin
Create a list of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'.
Imagine you are writing code to display a greeting to each user after they log in to a website.

Loop through the list and print a special greeting for the user 'admin', such as:
"Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?"

For all other users, print a standard greeting like:
"Hello Jaden, thank you for logging in again."

ðŸ”¹ 5.9. No Users
Add an if test to your code from 5.8 that checks whether the list of users is empty.

If the list is empty, print: "We need to find some users!"

Remove all usernames from the list and make sure the program prints the correct message.

ðŸ”¹ 5.10. Checking Usernames
Build a program that simulates checking new usernames for availability.

Create a list current_users with five or more usernames.

Create another list new_users with five usernames, including at least one name that already exists in current_users.

Loop through new_users and check whether each name has already been used:

If it has, print a message asking the user to choose a new name.

If it hasnâ€™t, print a message saying the username is available.
