Understand boolean logic (True / False)

Use comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, etc.)

Write nested and chained conditions

Practice decision-making in programs

Exercises Completed:
5-3 to 5-7:
Created small programs simulating:

Alien color-based scoring system

Age-based category classification

Favorite fruits check

Each task involved improving logic flow, understanding condition hierarchy, and implementing best practices like clean else usage.

Time & Reflections:
Total Time Spent: ~58 minutes

Learned: Importance of condition order and debugging logic errors

Next Chapter: Working with dictionaries (Chapter 6)
