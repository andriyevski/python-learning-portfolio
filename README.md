🧠 Goal: Review and reinforce Python fundamentals → Develop a fully functional Django project with an API and front-end.

US: Code and projects for learning and reviewing Python and Django

## Stages:

✅ Part 1: Python Crash Course- 

⏳ Part 2: Django + API (In Progress)- 

🔜 Part 3: Product / MVP (TBD)

## Why I repeat Python: After practical experience, it's important to structure knowledge, so I use a book as a basic framework + git commits + explanations.
