US: Code and projects for learning and reviewing Python and Django

## Stages:

✅ Part 1: Python Crash Course- 

⏳ Part 2: Django + API (In Progress)- 

🔜 Part 3: Product / MVP (TBD)

## Why I repeat Python: After practical experience, it's important to structure knowledge, so I use a book as a basic framework + git commits + explanations.

## 🛠 Requirements & Setup
1. Install Python 3.13.3
2. Create a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate #
   Linux/macOSvenvScriptsactivate.bat # Windows
  ```

# 🤝 Contributin
## Participating in the project
- Add your fork, create a branch feature/your-name
- Submit a pull request with a description of the changes
- Follow PEP 8 and add minimal tests if possible

# 📂 Repository Structure
##The structure of the repository
- `.gitignore` — a list of files and folders ignored by Git
- `LICENSE` — GPL-3.0 license
- `README.md` — this file with the description
